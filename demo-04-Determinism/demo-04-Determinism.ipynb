    "*ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation)* is a set of metrics used to evaluate the quality of automatic summaries of text. It compares a machine-generated summary to a set of human-written reference summaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "Focus on Recall: ROUGE focuses on recall, which means it measures how much of the important information from the original text is captured in the summary. It doesn't penalize the model for including information not present in the original text (precision).\n",
    "\n",
    "N-gram Overlap: ROUGE scores are based on the overlap between the n-grams (sequences of n words) in the machine-generated summary and the reference summaries. The most common n-grams used are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- ROUGE-1 (unigram): This measures the overlap of single words between the summary and references.\n",
    "- ROUGE-2 (bigram): This measures the overlap of two-word phrases.\n",
    "- ROUGE-L (Longest Common Subsequence): This considers the longest sequence of words that appears in both the summary and a reference summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Score Calculation: ROUGE scores are typically between 0 and 1, with a higher score indicating a better match between the summary and the reference summaries. The score represents the ratio between the number of matching n-grams in the summary and the total number of n-grams in the reference summaries."
